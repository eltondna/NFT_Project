        <H2 style="color:#90BEcd">Gas fee of NFT</H2>
        Gas is the unit that measures the amount of computational power required to perform a transaction on the blockchain. Each transaction on the Ethereum blockchain requires a number of processing processes to be completed. Additionally, the resources utilized in each step must be paid for by the buyers or sellers. Gas fee is the cost you incur for the quantity of gas utilized during the transaction. The payment is made to validators so they can stake their ETH and carry out transactions on a blockchain. Gas fee is incurred in all blockchain transactions, such as minting, buying, selling and transferring NFTs and crypto. 
<br/> <br/>
        The exact formula for <span class="bold">Ethereum gas =Gas units (limit) x (Base fee + Tip)</span>. Gas prices fluctuate because the supply and demand for the Ethereum network. If there is a huge demand for transactions, more miners are needed to handle the challenging algorithms, which increases effort and energy use. Therefore, the cost of gas could go up. The maximum amount of gas you are willing to spend on a transaction is referred to as the gas limit. A larger gas limit typically indicates that your transaction takes precedence over those whose gas limits are lower. Thus, you might have to pay more to entice the miners to handle your transaction for you first if you want it to complete more quickly during the time of high demand.
