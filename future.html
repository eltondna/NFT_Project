         <p style="font-size: 25px; width:600px; float:right; margin-top: -550px"><span style="font-size: 35px;">Metaverse</span> is a virtual world where users interact, connect with each other
             with digital-generated objects and avatars in a shared and digital 3D space. <br><br>
             Activities like social networking, online gaming, education, training and entertainment are carried out in the metaverse. 
             <br><br>
             Similar to the real world, the presence of objects and buildings are created and built by humans in digital forms in the metaverse. As NFT digital assets are
             created in the digital form and transferred virtually,
             users can own and use them in the metaverse with AR&VR technology.

             <span style="font-size: 35px;">CryptoKitties</span> is the first NFT game in which users bought, collected, and sold digital pets. 
             Besides, users could upgrade their digital pets by endowing them with unique characteristics. <br><br>
             With the special characteristic of NFT asset, 
             any NFT in-game items can be sold and transferred, which endow the value of the digital asset.

                Buying NFTs is a form of owning a &#8220 picture for proof &#8221 (PFP) of the authenticity of their identity. Such a picture is regarded as a digital identification, giving a privilege to the holder. <br><br>
                In the future, NFT-protected virtual identities will act as digital passports, which cannot be stolen, hacked, or counterfeited.<br><br>
                Theoretically, it is possible to create a digital concert ticket by storing it in blockchain, which enhances the right of ownership and prevents scalpers from selling tickets at a higher price due to high transparency.

            <p style="font-size: 25px; width:600px; float:right;">Nowadays, many authentic items and numerous fakes are sold on eBay, Amazon, Yahoo, and other eCommerce platforms
                but it is difficult for a buyer to distinguish a fake from the authentic one. <br><br>
                In the future, NFT technology is very likely to be the key to solving this issue. The brand owner makes a digital copy of the original NFT, 
                where the information about the particular item or ownership of physical assets is recorded. 
                <br><br>
                Therefore, a digital certificate along with the item enhances the authenticity of the product. As the NFT keeps a record of the transaction since it was created, it is nearly impossible that the buyer to be deceived,
                making NFT based authentication system useful and common.
