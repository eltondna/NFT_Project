        <li class="bold">Uniquness</li>
        NFTs are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and have a distinct attribute, which is recorded in token information. For example, a plan ticket is unique because of the seat of plane, the flight and the time of the flight are specified, meaning that no two tickets are alike.
        </p> 
            
        <p>
            <li class="bold">Indivisibility</li>
            The smallest unit of each NFT exists as a whole and cannot be circulated in units of measurement below "1" like other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Therefore, it’s can’t be broken into smaller denominations and transferred proportionally.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            <li class="bold">Ownership</li>
            NFTs combine the features of decentralized blockchain technology with non-fungible assets. Unlike ordinary digital assets, which are issued and regulated by a centralized entity. NFT crypto assets can be acquired at the time of use or can give the owner true ownership; true ownership is one of the key components of any NFT.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            <li class="bold">Transparency </li>
            The publicly distributed ledgers are decentralized and immutable, indicating the record of token issuance and transfer is publicly verified and seen by everyone.
